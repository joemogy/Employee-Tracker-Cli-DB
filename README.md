## Mock-Up

The youtube link, attached in the following section (Getting Started & Installation) is the mockup of how the backend of the application is ran.

**Getting Started**
---
To use this application you first need to install all dependencies by navigating to the root folder and running

```
npm install
```

We then need to create and populate the database with information.

After navigating to the 'db' folder and logging in to mysql we do this by using

```
source schema.sql
```

and

```
source seeds.sql
```

Finally to initiate the application, we return to the root folder and use the command

```
node index.js
```
