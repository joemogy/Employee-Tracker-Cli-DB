Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).  
A command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Description

This application allows the user to easily access the employee database and browse through the information while having command-line functionality to add and update the employee database. Through the backend development of Node and 4 packages, users can securely access all employee's data with some command-line functionality.
